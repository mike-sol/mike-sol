Hello! I am **Mike Sollanych**, a devops engineer.

Most of my work is for my employer, so you won't see a tremendous amount of repositories or commits here. I like to work on anything from on-premise systems, to cloud and serverless workloads; and I do a ton of monitoring work, from watching the temperatures in cryogenic refridgerators to the throughput on data pipelines. I'm not scared of the build system and I actually like racking servers. I've built front-end business applications, backend automation, and many things in between. I even managed a few thousand Windows desktops from a comfy corner office at SFU, once upon a time. It's a living!

PS: I joined this strange anachronistic github webring because it reminds me of back when the Internet was cool. You should join too:
